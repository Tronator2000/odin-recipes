        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The original plan for this deliciously different hot sandwich was simply going to be a chicken-based version of a pulled pork sandwich. But then I remembered I'm not the biggest fan of pulled pork sandwiches, or at least tossing shredded meat in barbecue sauce before serving on a bun. That's why I decided to try the sloppy Joe approach — and I could not have been happier with the results.</p>
        <p>Above and beyond the great taste and texture, these "sloppy chickens" were incredibly simple to make. All we do is dump everything in the saucepan, simmer until tender, and then eat. This is a classic example of a recipe they call "dump recipes," but just because "they" call them that, doesn't mean we have to (and I really hope you don't).</p>
        <p>The only big decision you'll have to make, besides what else to toss in spice-wise, is how wet or dry to make yours. You can let the sauce reduce while the chicken cooks like I did, for a "drier" sandwich that you can possibly eat with your hands. You can also cover the pan, so the mixture stays saucier, and enjoy your sloppy chicken with a fork. I prefer the thicker, less saucy approach, but both would be fantastic, and no matter which direction you go, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!</p>

            <li>1/2 large yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>3/4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dices jalapeño pepper</li>
            <li>4 medium hamburger buns - split, toasted and buttered</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Add vegetable oil to a saucepan, and then add (in this order) garlic, yellow onion, brown sugar, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne, chicken thighs, ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.</p></li>
            <li><p>Place over high heat and wait until you can hear the garlic sizzling in the bottom of the pan, about 30 seconds. Let garlic sizzle for about 30 seconds before adding the water. Stir everything together and wait for the mixture to boil.</p></li>
            <li><p>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken falls apart, about 1 1/2 hours.</p></li>
            <li><p>Stir in the green onions and peppers and cook until the peppers just turn tender, 3 to 5 minutes more. Taste for seasoning.</p></li>
            <li><p>Remove from heat and serve on toasted hamburger buns.</p></li>
        </ol>
